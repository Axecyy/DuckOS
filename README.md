# DuckOS

## What is DuckOS?

A open-sourced Windows operating system, which is a modification of the original windows 10, designed to reduce performance and latency.

### **What do we offer?**

DuckOS is pre-tweaked. While maintaining compatibility, but also good for performance. Here's a good list of what we did to make the image very fast:

- Disabled Power Saving
- Automatically enabled MSI Mode
- Custom Power Plan
- Minimized Drivers
- Minimized Services
- Disabled every single bit of telemetry, meaning your private and don't have to worry about anyone spying on you -- including group policies, registry edits, and more!
- Disabled Unneeded Devices
- Boot Configuration Optimization
- Optimized Process Scheduling
- 600+ Components removed.
- Removed almost every unneeded windows boot entry, including clearing scheduled tasks...

#### Why shoud we trust you?

DuckOS is a new OS made in early July of 2022. Since it's really new, lot's of bugs are expected, but, we are open sourced, meaning every line we have on our GitHub (this page), will execute on your System once you install the operating system, of course, not everything, but the most essential tweaks and etc.
Also, most computers don't have wifi on the first boot when they install it, so even if we DID, but we don't, grab IP adresses, they wouldn't send because internet is probably not working..

## DuckOS vs Windows 10 Original (*stock*)

DuckOS is really good at many things, here's a list that why you **shoud use** DuckOS and **not** Windows 10 Original (*stock*):
- Processes, while it doesn't matter as much, it's good too see that not much is running on your system.. which is a good sign of good component removing.
- Ram Usage, matters, because Windows 10 Original wastes your RAM doing nothing, we made sure that doesn't happen on DuckOS by removing lot's of components.
- Less services
- Less unneeded drivers
- More FPS, less lags in general
- Faster wifi due to tweaks
- and more!

### Security

Since there are a lot of features disabled like for performance, we also matter about security..

**What do we do?**

We disable features that can leak personal information or be exploited and be used in a large attack.
Those features are: 

- [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
- [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
- [DMA Remapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)
- [(P) ATMFD Exploit](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1020)
- [(P) Print Nightmare](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability)
- [Remote Desktop](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Windows+Remote+Desktop)
- [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS) (*Possible Information Retrieval*)

*NOTE: Clicking on the blue text will re-direct you to a link with a explanation for each and every feature.*
*NOTE2: Some features/mitigations that have been fixed, if they contain a (P) they are security risks for that feature have been fixed:*

But we aren't perfect, and here's some things you shoud considered before installing DuckOS on your computer:
- More likely to crash (not always the case)
- Lots of features disabled/broken/limited due to lots of stuff removed
- More likely to give you weird, but fixable errors.
- You have to manually install drivers.. 

### **Debloated**

DuckOS is heavily debloated, pre-installed applications and other components are removed. Although this can break some compatibility, it significantly reduces ISO and install size, making the iso 1.30GB average. Functionalities such as Windows Defender, and such are stripped completely. This modification is focused on pure gaming, but most work and business.
